ExplorerQuickSearch
===================

Command line tool to automatically pop up a windows explorer window with search results by generating .search-ms file

For details on what spawned this you can see my question on SuperUser.com:

I will probably rename the QuickSearch.exe to qs.exe and throw it in my %PATH% somewhere.

That will allow me to just Winkey+R and type: 
   qs C:\download\*.zip
